# Hospital Management System

In this project, we address the traditional challenges of hospital management by modernizing the paper-based system used for maintaining OPD records. The legacy system burdened doctors, receptionists, and administrators with inefficient data management, leading to issues such as improper data handling, time-consuming storage and retrieval processes, and difficulties for patients in understanding prescriptions. Our solution introduces a web-based application developed in Java with a MySQL backend, utilizing SpringMVC and Hibernate frameworks. This system offers distinct user accounts for doctors and staff, streamlining patient data management and enabling quick access to previous visit records. Enhanced features include an intuitive interface for managing employees and generating PDF prescriptions, thereby eliminating the need for manual writing and signatures, improving efficiency and accuracy.
